# Simple email Application
The objective of this work is to develop an end‐to‐end email application which
enables the users to send emails to other users and retrieve the emails destined for them.
The current email applications we use everyday (gmail, yahoo mail, microsoft outlook or
mozilla thunderbird) are complex and their architectural designs are often proprietary and
beyond the scope of this lab. Hence, a simpler email application has been developed
which provides only the basic functionalities. We call the application ‘Garuda’, named after
the mythological ​humanoid bird.
