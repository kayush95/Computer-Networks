# Implementing Traceroute using raw sockets
Traceroute is a utility that records the route (the specific gateway computers at each hop)
through the Internet between your computer and a specified destination computer. It also
calculates and displays the amount of time each hop took. Traceroute is a handy tool both
for understanding where problems are in the Internet network and for getting a detailed
sense of the Internet itself.
