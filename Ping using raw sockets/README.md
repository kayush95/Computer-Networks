# Implementing ping using raw sockets
The ping command got its name from the sound sonar makes when it "sees" something. In
sonar, you send out a signal and measure the time it takes to get there. The ping command
does the same thing. This tells if a computer or device is out there or not, which is the
purpose of the command. ​ It is basically a network diagnostic tool that’s used to check if a host
in a network is alive and responding. Ping uses ICMP messages. More particularly ICMP query
messages.
